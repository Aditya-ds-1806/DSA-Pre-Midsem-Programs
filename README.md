Imagine n ticket counters and the maximum customers in a counter can be k. Let r be the rate at which customers are served in all counters(per iteration). Initially, assume a total of m customers arrive. Each customer is given an integer token in increasing order. Any customers who cannot be accommodated in ticket counters form a waiting list line in their order of arrival(token number). Repeat the scenario until the last customer is served. A counter closes if it has no customers to serve. A closed counter does not reopen
